## üî¨ Research Interests

Akkas Ali is a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a lecturer in the Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh. His research focuses on **T cell biology in aging**, particularly **T cell Age-Associated (TAA) cells**‚Äîa newly discovered subset of immune cells that appear only later in life and may drive brain inflammation linked to dementia. Through his work, Akkas aims to uncover how these cells change with age and explore new ways to protect brain health in older adults.

**Key Research Areas:**
‚Ä¢ **Aging Immunology** - T cell biology and immune system changes with age  
‚Ä¢ **Vascular Dementia** - Brain inflammation and neurodegeneration mechanisms  
‚Ä¢ **T Cell Age-Associated (TAA) Cells** - Novel immune cell subsets in aging  
‚Ä¢ **Spectral Flow Cytometry** - Advanced multi-parameter flow cytometric analysis  
‚Ä¢ **Single-cell Analysis** - High-resolution cellular characterization techniques  
‚Ä¢ **Molecular Medicine** - Translational research approaches  
‚Ä¢ **Computational Biology** - Data analysis and bioinformatics approaches

## üß¨ Brief Bio

I am a PhD candidate focused on advancing our understanding of immune cell populations through cutting-edge spectral flow cytometry and single-cell analysis techniques. My research philosophy centers on leveraging computational approaches to decode complex biological systems and translate findings into meaningful clinical insights, particularly in the context of aging-related immune dysfunction and its connection to neurodegenerative diseases.

## üåü Personal Interests

Beyond the lab, I am passionate about exploring new places and cultures through travel, enjoy cycling to stay active, keep up with the latest movies, and value quality time with family and loved ones. These activities help me maintain a balanced perspective and often inspire creative approaches to my research.
